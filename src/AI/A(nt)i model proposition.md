# Model Proposition

OPTION 1 - hyper-aggressive food play - place grass all along border, tunnel in center, make extra worker off the bat, get 3+ workers, gather food extremely quickly while having ranged ant between food + tunnel to protect

OPTION 2 - Get one extra food, have drone kill worker ants for opposing team right away, then grind food

### Hill placement
place on some spot on back row, surround with grass
### Tunnel placement
center of map for easy access
### Food placement
As far away from enemy anthill as possible


Before every play, check if any worker ants exist - if not, make one

First - gather food until you get 2
If opposing side only has workers
