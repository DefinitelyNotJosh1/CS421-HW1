# Model Proposition


RUN GAME ON CL- 
python Game.py -2p -p Booger human -random Layout
python Game.py -2p -p Booger "Simple Food Gatherer"
python Game.py -self -p Booger

OPTION 1 - hyper-aggressive food play - place grass all along border, tunnel in center, make extra worker off the bat, get 3+ workers, gather food extremely quickly while having ranged ant between food + tunnel to protect

OPTION 2 - Get one extra food, have drone kill worker ants for opposing team right away, then grind food

OPTION 3 - Grind food up until 6, get 3 soldiers to kill queen

### Hill placement
place on some spot on back row, surround with grass
### Tunnel placement
center of map for easy access
### Food placement
As far away from enemy anthill as possible


Before every play, check if any worker ants exist - if not, make one

First - gather food until you get 2
If opposing side only has workers


MORE IDEAS:

If R_Soldier or Soldier is protecting workers, retreat drone
If an ant is on my side, create soldier ant to protect queen/defend hill



PROPOSAL TREE:

(Stage 1 - game start)                      [START - 1 food]
                                Make another worker; gather food immediately
                        
(Stage 2 - 2 food) [if opponent has only workers, create drone and go after them]  [if not, create ranged soldier to protect food gatherers]

(Stage 3)
